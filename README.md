# Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree Project #5

### Restaurant Reviews App

## Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

#### Note: starter code was provided. See commits for my work.


## How to Launch the App

1. Download the files for this project.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## How to Use the App
Once you have the app running, you can navigate through the map to see different restaurant locations. Choose a restaurant to find more details and reviews of that restaurant.
