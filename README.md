# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I will took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

##How to Run the Restaurant Review App

1. Download the files for this project.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
